# TERRA-FIC - A "Terrific" Or "Terraform - Fiction" (pardon my attempt at wordplay) Wrapper For Terraform Written In Go

This repository contains **Terra-fic**, a lightweight CLI wrapper for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) written in Go. It aims to simplify common Terraform workflows by providing an intuitive interface and automating repetitive tasks. The project is ideal for users who want to streamline infrastructure management or explore Go-based CLI development.

## Usage Example

Assuming you have Go installed and have built the project:

```bash
# Plan your infrastructure changes
terrafic plan

# Apply the planned changes
terrafic apply
```

You can pass additional flags and arguments as needed, similar to the native Terraform CLI. For more details, run:

```bash
terrafic --help
```

## Thoughts
I know this might not make any sense or add any real world value but I was bored and tired of learning Go the usual way (videos and reading) and wanted to build something I imagined.
